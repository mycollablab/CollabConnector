# CollabConnector
 Cisco Collab Connector Library

This library is meant to be a single source for all Cisco Collab APIs (which can be lots). The goal is to unify requests and responces across different REST and SOAP APIs availble to make connecting to and scripting Collab tasks easier.  Hopefully.  Maybe.
